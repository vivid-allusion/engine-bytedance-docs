Ark CLI is the official command\-line tool for BytePlus ModelArk. You can use it in a local terminal to quickly authenticate and manage resources. You can also install its capabilities in commonly used AI agents and use natural language to invoke models, manage inference endpoints, generate content, and query usage and billing information.

## Get started

**Environment requirement:**  Node.js 16 or later

### 1. Install and sign in to Ark CLI

**Install and sign in manually**

#### Install Ark CLI

Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
# 1. Install Ark CLI through npm
npm install -g @byteplus/ark-cli

# 2. Verify the installation
arkcli --version
```

#### Sign in to Ark CLI

```bash
# Sign-in method 1: Browser sign-in (recommended)
arkcli auth login

# Sign-in method 2: Browserless sign-in / remote terminal sign-in
arkcli auth login --no-browser

# Check the sign-in status
arkcli auth status

# Install skills in your preferred AI agent, such as Claude Code, Cursor, TRAE, or Gemini CLI
arkcli +connect
```

**Install and sign in through an AI agent**

Copy the following prompt to an AI agent, such as Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or TRAE. The AI agent will install Ark CLI automatically.

```Plaintext
Install Ark CLI for me by using the following command: https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/psjryh/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/intro/byteplus.md
```

> **warning**

> To uninstall the skills, run `arkcli +connect uninstall` in a terminal.

### 2. Use Ark CLI

After configuration is complete, restart your AI agent. You can then describe your request in natural language. The following table provides some examples.

|What you want to do |Message to send to the AI agent |
|---|---|
|Query models |Show me the Dola and Dreamina models available on ModelArk. |
|Query usage |Show me how many tokens this account has used today and this week. |
|Query bills |Show me the latest bill and cost details. |
|Query plans |Show me the current Coding Plan subscription and seat information. |
|Change an API Key |Replace the API Key in the test profile with a valid one. |
|Chat with a model |Use a Dola model to answer this question: Should I carry an umbrella in Beijing today? |
|Understand an image |Describe what is in this image. |
|Understand a document |Extract the key information from this PDF. |
|Generate an image |Generate an image of a Shiba Inu running under cherry blossoms. |
|Generate a video |Generate a five\-second video of a cat jumping. |
|Deploy an endpoint |Deploy a test endpoint and tell me how to invoke it. |
|Clean up resources |Delete the test endpoint, generation task, and chat response that were just created. |

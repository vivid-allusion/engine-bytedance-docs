A region is a geographic area where compute resources for model inference are primarily provisioned and scheduled.

ModelArk currently supports the following regions:


* Johor, Asia Pacific (AP):

   * Region ID: `ap-southeast-1`

   * Base URL: `https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3`

* Dublin, Europe (EU):

   * Region ID: `eu-west-1`

   * Base URL: `https://ark.eu-west.bytepluses.com/api/v3`

# Key concepts

## Regional isolation

You access model services through region\-scoped customized online inference endpoints:


* An inference endpoint created in a region must be invoked using the region\-specific base URL. Inference endpoints in one region cannot be called through another region's URL.

* Platform\-level resources, such as API keys and model activation status, are isolated by region.


For example, when making the following request, ensure that the **Base URL** and **API key** are for the region in which the inference endpoint was created:

```Bash
curl https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARK_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "<AP_ENDPOINT_ID>",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

  -d '{
    "model": "<EU_ENDPOINT_ID>",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

## How inference requests are routed

Inference requests sent to an inference endpoint are primarily routed to the region where the endpoint is created. However, based on overall resource scheduling, some requests may be routed to inference resources in other regions.

|Case |Region |Request origin |Observed or expected routing behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
|Case 1 |AP |Singapore |Inference prefers AP, but may spill over to EU if needed |
|Case 2 |EU |Austria |Inference prefers EU, but may spill over to AP if needed |

# Switch between regions

You can switch regions from the upper\-left corner of the [console](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1).

After switching the region, the console displays resources available in and information about the current region.

[OpenClaw](https://clawd.bot/) (formerly known as Clawdbot) is an open\-source, self\-hosted personal AI assistant that runs locally on your computer. It is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux, and supports integration with popular chat tools. In addition to a rich set of built\-in agent tools, OpenClaw can be further extended through plugins and skills.

The ModelArk Coding Plan supports integration with OpenClaw. Refer to this article for configuration and usage instructions.

> **Tip**

> You must first access the [ModelArk Coding Plan campaign page](https://www.byteplus.com/en/activity/codingplan) and subscribe to a plan as required, and then configure your programming tools accordingly.

**Configure model name (via config file)**

# Key configuration

The key configurations for integrating tools are as follows:

## **Model selection**Specify the name of the model to be used in the configuration file of the tool.

The following models are supported:

* \`dola-seed-2.0-pro\`

* \`dola-seed-2.0-lite\`

* \`dola-seed-2.0-code\`

* \`glm-5.3-flash\`

* \`glm-5.2\`

* \`deepseek-v4.1-flash\`

* \`deepseek-v4-flash\`

* \`deepseek-v4-pro\`

> **Tip**

* > Due to regional regulatory requirements and other applicable considerations, the availability and features of the Model Service may vary by country or region. The final offering shall be subject to BytePlus’s actual provision.

* > The DeepSeek models are provided in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations.

**Configure ark-code-latest (in the console)**

1. Specify the model as \`ark-code-latest\` in the configuration file.

2. Select or switch the target model via the [management page](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=subscribe).

Auto mode is supported, and the model is automatically selected using an intelligent algorithm based on both "effect" and "speed" dimensions.

## **Base URL**

The Base URL differs by tool depending on the protocol it is compatible with:

* Tools compatible with the Anthropic protocol: https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding

* Tools compatible with the OpenAI protocol: https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3

> **Note**

> Do not use the Base model URL (https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3). Requests sent to this Base URL do not consume your Coding Plan quota and will instead incur additional charges.

> **Tip**

> You can create an API key in the [console](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apiKey?apikey=%7B%7D).

# Configure

After selecting the appropriate method based on the operating system to complete the configuration, the configuration file will include the complete list of models supported by Coding Plan, making it easy to quickly switch between target models.

## Method 1: Automated configuration (recommended)

ArkCLI Helper is a coding tool assistant that helps quickly configure the selected tool to connect to Coding Plan. Install and run it, then follow the on\-screen prompts to complete the tool configuration automatically, reducing manual setup time and the risk of errors.

> **Note**

* > ArkCLI Helper is an upgraded tool configuration service evolved from Ark Helper. Related capabilities will continue to iterate in ArkCLI Helper. We recommend using ArkCLI Helper for tool configuration.

* > ArkCLI Helper supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

1. Install Ark CLI.

   ```Bash
   # 1. Install Ark CLI through npm
   npm install -g @byteplus/ark-cli
   
   # 2. Verify the installation
   arkcli --version
   ```

2. Sign in to Ark CLI.

   ```Bash
   arkcli auth login
   ```

   Follow the on\-screen prompts to select a sign\-in method. On first sign\-in, complete the following configuration as prompted:

   1. Select a project: Choose one that fits your needs, or use the default.

   2. Select `coding-plan`.

3. Run ArkCLI Helper and follow the on\-screen prompts to complete the OpenClaw configuration.

   1. Enter the `arkcli helper` command in the terminal to start ArkCLI Helper.

   2. Select the Plan profile to configure: Choose `coding-plan_ap-southeast-1_personal (Coding Plan)`.

   3. Select the model to use.

   4. Select the AI agent to configure: `OpenClaw`.

After you complete these steps, OpenClaw is configured automatically. No manual installation is required.

## Method 2: Configure manually

Coding Plan is compatible with the OpenAI interface protocol and supports both Responses API and Chat API. The Responses API configuration is recommended for better reasoning quality.

The two API types share the same configuration structure; only the API adapter under `models.providers` differs:

* Responses API configuration: `"api": "openai-responses"`

* Chat API configuration: `"api": "openai-completions"`

> **warning**

> `glm-5.2`, `glm-5.3-flash`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, and `deepseek-v4-pro` support a 1M context window for long sessions involving large codebases. Specify the window size explicitly via the `contextWindow` field.

**Web UI**

1. Run the following command to open the Web UI.

```Bash
openclaw dashboard
```

2. In the left menu bar, select configuration \> **All Settings** \> **Raw** to view and modify the configuration. The specific configuration information is as follows. You need to replace `<ARK_API_KEY>` with your own [API Key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey).

> **warning**

* > If you have already configured OpenClaw, do not overwrite the existing configuration directly.

   > It is recommended to update the `models`, `agents`, and `gateway` node information according to the provided configuration. `models` contains the list of supported models.

3. After completing the configuration, save the file, and run the following command in the terminal to restart the service for the changes to take effect.

   ```Bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

## Get started

* Open TUI and view the Gateway status.

```Bash
openclaw tui
/status
```

* Open the Web UI and interact on the Chat page.

```Bash
openclaw dashboard
```

## Switch model

Please select the corresponding model switching solution according to the model configuration method.

* Model configuration: Configure the Model Name. The following two methods are supported for switching models.

   Prerequisite: Complete [Configure](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/coding-plan-personal-ai-openclaw#48c0b1ea), where `agents.defaults.models` contains the list of supported models.

   * Method 1: Global configuration (permanent)

      Set `agents.defaults.model.primary` in the configuration file to the target model. After the change, you need to restart the service.

      ```JSON
      {
          "agents": {
              "defaults": {
                  "model": {
                      "primary": "byteplus-plan/dola-seed-2.0-code"
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ```

   * Method 2: Switch model in the current session (temporary)

      After executing `openclaw tui` in the terminal, switch models via `/models`. When the interface returns "model set to <Model_Name\>", the configuration takes effect.

* Model configuration: `byteplus-plan/ark-code-latest`, switch models via the console.

   In the configuration file, `agents.defaults.model.primary` is set to `byteplus-plan/ark-code-latest`.

   Model switching actions: On the [activation management page](https://www.byteplus.com/en/activity/codingplan), select the model to use. The switch will take effect within 3–5 minutes.

# Integrate Feishu bot

## Prerequisites

# Advanced guide: Configure embedding models

The ModelArk Coding Plan provides the `skylark-embedding-vision` model, which enables OpenClaw to generate semantic vector representations, converting conversations, documentation, and task information into high\-dimensional vectors for efficient retrieval based on semantic similarity.

Compared to traditional keyword matching, embedding\-based retrieval can more accurately recall relevant content in scenarios with large volumes of information, lengthy conversations, and dispersed materials, significantly reducing omissions and misjudgments. Additionally, embedding provides a unified semantic indexing layer for memory retrieval, knowledge base Q&A, and tool invocation, helping OpenClaw improve cross\-turn context tracking and overall effectiveness without increasing the main model's inference cost.

Select any of the following methods to configure the embedding model.

**Web UI**

1. Execute the following command to open the Web UI.

```Bash
openclaw dashboard
```

2. In the left menu, select **configuration** \- **All Settings** \- **Raw**, then add `memorySearch` configuration information under the `agents.defaults` node. The configuration to be added is as follows. You need to replace `<ARK_API_KEY>` with your own [API Key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey).

   ```JSON
   {
     ...
     "agents": {
       "defaults": {

nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

2. Add `memorySearch` configuration information under the `agents.defaults` node. The configuration to be added is as follows. You need to replace `<ARK_API_KEY>` with your own [API Key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey).

   ```JSON
   {
     ...
     "agents": {
       "defaults": {
         ...
         "memorySearch": {
           "provider": "openai",
           "model": "skylark-embedding-vision",
           "remote": {
             "baseUrl": "https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3",
             "apiKey": "<ARK_API_KEY>"
           }
         }
         ...
       }
     }
     ...
   }
   ```

3. After completing the configuration, restart the gateway to make the configuration take effect.

   ```Bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

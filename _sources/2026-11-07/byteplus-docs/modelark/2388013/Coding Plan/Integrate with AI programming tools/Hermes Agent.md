[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) is an open\-source autonomous AI agent developed by Nous Research, featuring persistent memory across conversations and self\-learning capabilities. This article describes how to use the ModelArk Coding Plan in Hermes Agent.

**Configure model name (via config file)**

# Key configuration

The key configurations for integrating tools are as follows:

## **Model selection**Specify the name of the model to be used in the configuration file of the tool.

The following models are supported:

* \`dola-seed-2.0-pro\`

* \`dola-seed-2.0-lite\`

* \`dola-seed-2.0-code\`

* \`glm-5.3-flash\`

* \`glm-5.2\`

* \`deepseek-v4.1-flash\`

* \`deepseek-v4-flash\`

* \`deepseek-v4-pro\`

> **Tip**

* > Due to regional regulatory requirements and other applicable considerations, the availability and features of the Model Service may vary by country or region. The final offering shall be subject to BytePlus’s actual provision.

* > The DeepSeek models are provided in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations.

**Configure ark-code-latest (in the console)**

1. Specify the model as \`ark-code-latest\` in the configuration file.

2. Select or switch the target model via the [management page](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=subscribe).

Auto mode is supported, and the model is automatically selected using an intelligent algorithm based on both "effect" and "speed" dimensions.

## **Base URL**

The Base URL differs by tool depending on the protocol it is compatible with:

* Tools compatible with the Anthropic protocol: https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding

* Tools compatible with the OpenAI protocol: https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3

> **Note**

> Do not use the Base model URL (https://ark.ap\-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3). Requests sent to this Base URL do not consume your Coding Plan quota and will instead incur additional charges.

> **Tip**

> You can create an API key in the [console](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apiKey?apikey=%7B%7D).

# Prerequisites

Hermes Agent can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows systems.

## Configure

### Method 1: Automated configuration (recommended)

ArkCLI Helper is a coding tool assistant that helps quickly configure the selected tool to connect to Coding Plan. Install and run it, then follow the on\-screen prompts to complete the tool configuration automatically, reducing manual setup time and the risk of errors.

> **Note**

* > ArkCLI Helper is an upgraded tool configuration service evolved from Ark Helper. Related capabilities will continue to iterate in ArkCLI Helper. We recommend using ArkCLI Helper for tool configuration.

* > ArkCLI Helper supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

1. Install Ark CLI.

   ```Bash
   # 1. Install Ark CLI through npm
   npm install -g @byteplus/ark-cli
   
   # 2. Verify the installation
   arkcli --version
   ```

2. Sign in to Ark CLI.

   ```Bash
   arkcli auth login
   ```

   Follow the on\-screen prompts to select a sign\-in method. On first sign\-in, complete the following configuration as prompted:

   1. Select a project: Choose one that fits your needs, or use the default.

   2. Select `coding-plan`.

3. Run ArkCLI Helper and follow the on\-screen prompts to complete the Hermes Agent configuration.

   1. Enter the `arkcli helper` command in the terminal to start ArkCLI Helper.

   2. Select the Plan profile to configure: Choose `coding-plan_ap-southeast-1_personal (Coding Plan)`.

   3. Select the model to use.

   4. Select the AI agent to configure: `Hermes Agent`.

After you complete these steps, Hermes Agent is configured automatically. No manual installation is required.

### Method 2: Configure manually

Coding Plan is compatible with the OpenAI interface protocol and supports both Responses API and Chat API. The Responses API configuration is recommended for better reasoning quality.

**Responses API**

> **warning**

> To use Responses API, set `api_mode: codex_responses`.

Run the following commands to configure Hermes Agent. Replace `<ARK_API_KEY>` with your own [API Key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey). For supported models, see [Key configuration](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/coding-plan-personal-ai-hermes-agent#8f1d9f20).

```Bash
hermes config set model.provider custom
hermes config set model.base_url https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3
hermes config set model.api_key <ARK_API_KEY>
hermes config set model.default ark-code-latest
hermes config set model.api_mode codex_responses
```

After configuration, the contents of `~/.hermes/config.yaml` are as follows. You can also edit this file directly.

```YAML
model:
  default: ark-code-latest
  provider: custom
  base_url: https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3
  api_key: <ARK_API_KEY>
  api_mode: codex_responses
```

**Chat API**

> **warning**

> To use Chat API, set `api_mode: chat_completions`.

Run the following commands to configure Hermes Agent. Replace `<ARK_API_KEY>` with your own [API Key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey). For supported models, see [Key configuration](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/coding-plan-personal-ai-hermes-agent#8f1d9f20).

```Bash
hermes config set model.provider custom
hermes config set model.base_url https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3
hermes config set model.api_key <ARK_API_KEY>
hermes config set model.default ark-code-latest
hermes config set model.api_mode chat_completions
```

After configuration, the contents of `~/.hermes/config.yaml` are as follows. You can also edit this file directly.

```YAML
model:
  default: ark-code-latest
  provider: custom
  base_url: https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3
  api_key: <ARK_API_KEY>
  api_mode: chat_completions
```

> **tip**

* > To use a 1M context window, simply select a model that supports 1M context; Hermes Agent adjusts automatically without additional configuration.

* > If a model supports 1M context but Hermes Agent does not detect it correctly, manually add or edit the `context_length` field for the corresponding model in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`: `context_length: 1048576`.

**OpenViking** is a context database purpose\-built for AI agents, designed for scenarios such as multi\-agent collaboration, long\-term memory management, and complex task execution. It adopts a `viking://` filesystem paradigm to organize and manage an agent's **memories, resources, and skills** in a unified structure. With hierarchical, on\-demand loading, it supplies context only when needed—reducing token consumption while improving runtime efficiency. Directory\-based retrieval further enhances recall quality.

OpenViking supports **isolation across tenants, users, and agents**. After a session ends, it can automatically persist long\-term memory, enabling continuous capability accumulation and self\-optimization. This reduces the developer burden of context management and significantly improves the overall performance of agent frameworks such as OpenClaw.

ModelArk Coding Plan can be used with OpenViking. Follow this guide to configure and start using it.

> **Note**

> The OpenViking tool is undergoing rapid iteration. The version used in this document is **0.4.15**. If there are differences between actual usage and the steps below, see [OpenViking: Context database for AI agents](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking/blob/main/README.md).

> **Tip**

> You must first visit [ModelArk Coding Plan event](https://www.byteplus.com/en/activity/codingplan), subscribe to a plan as needed, and then configure and use the tool.

# Key configuration

## Model configuration

### VLM model

The VLM models and configuration methods supported by Coding Plan are as follows:

**Configure Model Name (specified in configuration file)**

Specify the Model Name in the tool configuration file to switch models in real time. Supported Model Names for configuration:

> **warning**

> When configuring Model Name, you can use all lowercase letters, and you can also directly copy the model name from the [activation management page](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=model).

* `dola-seed-2.0-pro`

* `dola-seed-2.0-lite`

* `dola-seed-2.0-code`

* `glm-5.2`

* `glm-5.3-flash`

* `deepseek-v4-flash`

* `deepseek-v4-pro`

* `deepseek-v4.1-flash`

> **tip**

> The DeepSeek models are provided in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations.

**Configure ark-code-latest (console management)**

1. Specify the model as `ark-code-latest` in the configuration file.

2. Use [the activation management page](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=model) to select or switch the target model. The change will take effect within 3–5 minutes.

   Supports Auto mode, which uses a dual\-dimension intelligent algorithm based on "effect + speed" to automatically select the model.

### Embedding model

The Embedding model supported by Coding Plan: `skylark-embedding-vision`

## Base URL

Use the dedicated Coding Plan Base URL: `https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/coding/v3` (compatible with OpenAI API protocol)

# Get started with OpenViking

1. Create the Python file `example.py` with the following code content.

   ```Python
   import openviking as ov
   
   # Initialize OpenViking client with data directory
   client = ov.OpenViking(path="./data")
   
   try:
       # Initialize the client
       client.initialize()
   
       # Add resource (supports URL, file, or directory)
       add_result = client.add_resource(
           path="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcengine/OpenViking/refs/heads/main/README.md"
       )
       root_uri = add_result['root_uri']
   
       # Explore the resource tree structure
       ls_result = client.ls(root_uri)
       print(f"Directory structure:\n{ls_result}\n")
   
       # Use glob to find markdown files
       glob_result = client.glob(pattern="**/*.md", uri=root_uri)
       if glob_result['matches']:
           content = client.read(glob_result['matches'][0])
           print(f"Content preview: {content[:200]}...\n")
   
       # Wait for semantic processing to complete
       print("Wait for semantic processing...")
       client.wait_processed()
   
       # Get abstract and overview of the resource
       abstract = client.abstract(root_uri)
       overview = client.overview(root_uri)
       print(f"Abstract:\n{abstract}\n\nOverview:\n{overview}\n")
   
       # Perform semantic search
       results = client.find("what is openviking", target_uri=root_uri)
       print("Search results:")
       for r in results.resources:
           print(f"  {r.uri} (score: {r.score:.4f})")
   
       # Close the client
       client.close()
   
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
   ```

2. Run `python example.py`. If the following output is displayed, OpenViking is running successfully.

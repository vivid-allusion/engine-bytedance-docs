ModelArk API is compatible with the OpenAI and Anthropic API protocols and can be used in third\-party tools. You can see this topic for configuration and usage.

# Ecosystem compatibility

To meet developers' needs for using the OpenAI API and Anthropic API ecosystems, ModelArk API now supports adaptation to both interface formats and is fully compatible with mainstream large model API specifications and related tool ecosystems. Developers do not need to modify core code. They only need to switch the base URL and API key to make cross\-platform model calls and integrate tools.

When configuring third\-party tools, use the base URL information in the table below.

> **Tip**

> Before configuring tools, you need to [activate the required model services](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement).

ModelArk API includes built\-in tools such as Web Search (not available for BytePlus). After activation, you can use them directly in third\-party tools such as Claude Code and Codex CLI. We recommend using them first. If your use case is not covered by the built\-in tools, you can also integrate second\-party and third\-party MCP servers and skills into third\-party tools yourself to extend the capabilities available to the model. For each tool's integration method, see the corresponding sections below.

## Get an MCP server

* **Third\-party**: Integrate MCP servers provided by other MCP marketplaces, or deploy open\-source MCP servers yourself.

> **Note**

> Obtain MCP servers from trusted sources. Their security and stability are the responsibility of the provider. Before integration, confirm that their permission scope meets your expectations.

# Integrate Codex CLI

## Installation steps

> **Tip**

> Coding Plan supports the Responses API, so you can use the latest version of Codex CLI.

Prerequisite: Install [Node.js 18 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

In the command\-line interface, run the following command to install Codex CLI.

```Bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
```

After installation is complete, run the following command to check the version.

```Bash
codex --version
```

## Configure tools

1. Create and open the Codex configuration file. The file path varies by system. Use the following steps:

**macOS/Linux**

macOS/Linux Codex configuration file path: `~/.codex/config.toml`.

1. If the `.codex` directory does not exist in the home directory, run the following command to create it.

   ```Bash
   mkdir -p ~/.codex
   ```

2. Create and open the configuration file.

   ```Bash
   nano ~/.codex/config.toml
   ```

**Windows**

Windows Codex configuration file path: `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml`. The following uses the CMD command line as an example.

1. If the `.codex` directory does not exist in the current user directory, run the following command to create it.

   ```Bash
   if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\.codex" mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.codex"
   ```

2. Create and open the configuration file.

   ```Bash
   notepad "%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml"
   ```

2. Edit `config.toml`. The configuration information to focus on is as follows:

   * `<Model ID>`: Select a model as needed and obtain the [model ID](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/model-list).

   * `env_key`: This sets the environment variable name. Do not directly modify `ARK_API_KEY`; you need to set the value of this environment variable in the next step.

   ```plaintext
   model = "<Model ID>"
   model_provider = "volcengine"
   
   [model_providers.volcengine]
   name = "volcengine"
   base_url = "https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3"
   env_key = "ARK_API_KEY"
   wire_api = "responses"
   ```

   > **Note**

   * > `model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true`: Enable reasoning capabilities.

   * > `model_reasoning_effort`: Controls the thinking effort. You can set it to `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

   * > minimax\-m2.7, kimi\-k2.6, and kimi\-k2.7\-code do not support setting `model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true`.

3. Configure the environment variable. Set the `ARK_API_KEY` environment variable to the [API key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey).

   **macOS / Linux**

1. Check the shell type.

         ```Bash
         echo $SHELL
         ```

      2. Write the environment variable to the shell configuration file so that it automatically takes effect when a new terminal is opened.

         * Zsh

            ```Bash
            # Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key.
            echo 'export ARK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' >> ~/.zshrc
            source ~/.zshrc
            ```

         * Bash

            ```Bash
            # Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key.
            echo 'export ARK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' >> ~/.bashrc
            source ~/.bashrc
            ```

   **Windows**

* CMD: After the environment variable is set, it takes effect in a newly opened CMD window.

         ```Bash
         # Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key.
         setx ARK_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
         # Open a new window and check whether the environment variable has taken effect
         echo %ARK_API_KEY%
         ```

      * PowerShell: After the environment variable is set, it takes effect in a newly opened PowerShell window.

         ```Bash
         # Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key.
         [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ARK_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
         # Open a new window and check whether the environment variable has taken effect
         echo $env:ARK_API_KEY
         ```

## Get started

Run the following command to start Codex CLI.

```Bash
codex
```

## Integrate second\-party/third\-party MCP servers

If the built\-in tools do not cover your use case, you can integrate second\-party or third\-party MCP servers in Codex CLI. For how to obtain them, see [Get an MCP server](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/integrate-third-party-tools#c5f28d13).

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` on Windows) and add the MCP server configuration.

```plaintext
[mcp_servers.<MCP_name>]
command = "<launch_command>"
args = ["<launch_arguments>"]
```

Restart Codex CLI for the configuration to take effect.

# Integrate Claude Code

## Installation steps

Prerequisites:

* Install [Node.js 18 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

* Windows users must install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

In the command\-line interface, run the following command to install Claude Code.

```Bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After installation is complete, run the following command to check the installation result. If a version number is displayed, the installation is successful.

```Bash
claude --version
```

## Configure tools

After installing Claude Code, configure the following information.

* **ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL**: `https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/compatible`

* **ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN**: [Get API key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey)

* **ANTHROPIC_MODEL**: [Select a model and get the model ID](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/model-list)

   The configuration steps are as follows:

1. Edit or add the `settings.json` file, and replace the following information in the configuration:

   * `<ARK_API_KEY>`: Replace it with the [API key](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apikey).

   * `<Model_Name>`: Replace it with the [model ID](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/model-list) you want to use.

> **Tip**

> The configuration file paths differ by system, as follows:

* > macOS & Linux: `~/.claude/settings.json`

* > Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.claude\settings.json`

The following uses `dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628` as an example. The configuration is as follows:

```JSON
{
    "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "<ARK_API_KEY>",
        "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/compatible",
        "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628",
        "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "seed-2-0-lite-260428",
        "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628",
        "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628",
        "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL": "dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628"
    }
}
```

> **Note**

* > We recommend using the complete model configuration and selecting models based on task complexity: Haiku (lightweight), Sonnet (daily use), and Opus (complex).

* > We recommend keeping `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` consistent with the main model.

* > We recommend setting `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` to a small model, such as `seed-2-0-lite-260428`. This usually does not affect the overall usage experience.

2. Edit or add the `.claude.json` file, and modify or add the `hasCompletedOnboarding` parameter with the value `true`.

> **Tip**

> The configuration file paths differ by system, as follows:

* > macOS and Linux: `~/.claude.json`

* > Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.claude.json`

```JSON
{
  "hasCompletedOnboarding": true
}
```

After saving the configuration file, run the subsequent commands in a new terminal window.

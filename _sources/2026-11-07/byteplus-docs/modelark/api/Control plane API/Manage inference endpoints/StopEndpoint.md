`POST https://ark.ap-southeast-1.byteplusapi.com/?Action=StopEndpoint&Version=2024-01-01`

Stops a specified inference endpoint. After it is stopped, the endpoint no longer accepts inference requests. Call *StartEndpoint* to restart it.

> **Note**

> You can stop only an endpoint in the `Running` state. Stopping an endpoint that is already in the `Stopped` state returns an error. The stop operation is asynchronous. After the API call succeeds, the endpoint enters the `Stopping` state and changes to `Stopped` when the operation is complete. The endpoint does not accept inference requests while it is stopping. For postpaid endpoints, billing stops after the endpoint is stopped. Call *StartEndpoint* to restart it.

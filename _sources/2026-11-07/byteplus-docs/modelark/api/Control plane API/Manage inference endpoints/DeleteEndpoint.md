> After an endpoint is deleted, it **cannot be recovered**. Before deletion, the endpoint must be in the `Stopped` state and must not have any active bound Agents. For an endpoint bound to a prepaid model unit, you can delete it only when the corresponding TPM resource has been reclaimed or its creation failed. Otherwise, unsubscribe from the resource first.

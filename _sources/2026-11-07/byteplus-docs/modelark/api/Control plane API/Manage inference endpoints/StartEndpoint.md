`POST https://ark.ap-southeast-1.byteplusapi.com/?Action=StartEndpoint&Version=2024-01-01`

Starts a specified inference endpoint and restores it from the stopped state to an available state.

> **Note**

> You can start only an endpoint in the `Stopped` state. Starting an endpoint that is already in the `Running` state returns an error. The start operation is asynchronous. After the API call succeeds, the endpoint enters the `Starting` state and changes to `Running` when ready. For postpaid endpoints, billing starts when the endpoint enters the `Running` state.

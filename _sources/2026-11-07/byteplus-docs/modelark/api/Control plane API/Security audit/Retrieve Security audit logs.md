### Body parameters

**Filter** `object` `Required`  |  Filter conditions

The filter conditions for audit logs. You can specify a time range, risk levels, a log type, and custom conditions.

**LogType** `string` `Required`  |  Log type

`Filter.LogType`

The audit log type to filter by. `SshLogin` indicates SSH login to a secure sandbox, `ContainerLogin` indicates local login to a secure sandbox, `Connection` indicates outbound network connections from a secure sandbox, `ContainerBreakout` indicates a secure sandbox container escape, `VarmorDefence` indicates vArmor protection, `KMSAccess` indicates KMS access, and `TksAccess` indicates Trusted Key Service (TKS) key access. Options: `SshLogin` / `ContainerLogin` / `Connection` / `ContainerBreakout` / `VarmorDefence` / `KMSAccess` / `TksAccess` / `AuthStatistic` / `Auth`.

> **Note**

> `TksAccess` is currently a paid feature in private beta. Contact your sales manager to enable it if needed.

**Conditions** `object[]`  |  Custom filter conditions

`Filter.Conditions`

The list of custom filter conditions, which filter audit logs using combinations of fields, operators, and values.

**Field** `string` `Required`  |  Field name

`Filter.Conditions.Field`

The name of the field to filter by.

**Operator** `string` `Required`  |  Operator

`Filter.Conditions.Operator`

The comparison operator used in the filter condition.

**Value** `string` `Required`  |  Filter value

`Filter.Conditions.Value`

The target value to compare against in the filter condition.

**EndTime** `integer`  |  End time

`Filter.EndTime`

The end of the query time range, as a Unix timestamp in seconds.

**RiskLevels** `string[]`  |  Risk level filter

`Filter.RiskLevels`

The list of risk levels to filter by. Logs matching any level in the list are returned. `Info` indicates a normal event, `Low` indicates low risk, `Medium` indicates medium risk, `High` indicates high risk, and `Critical` indicates critical risk.

**StartTime** `integer`  |  Start time

`Filter.StartTime`

The start of the query time range, as a Unix timestamp in seconds.

**ResourceId** `string` `Required`  |  Resource ID

The ID of the audited resource, used together with *ResourceType*. When *ResourceType* is `endpoint`, specify an inference endpoint ID (such as `ep-**************-*****`). When *ResourceType* is `modelcustomizationjob`, specify a model fine\-tuning job ID (such as `mcj-**************-*****`).

**ResourceType** `string` `Required`  |  Resource type

The type of the audited resource. `endpoint` indicates an inference endpoint, and `modelcustomizationjob` indicates a model fine\-tuning job.

**PageNumber** `integer` `Default 1`  |  Starting page number

The starting page number for pagination.

**Min**: `1`

**PageSize** `integer` `Default 10`  |  Records per page

The number of records returned per page for pagination.

**Range**: `[1, 100]`

**ProjectName** `string` `Default default`  |  Project name

The name of the project to which the resource belongs. If the resource is not in the default project, specify the correct project name.

**SortBy** `string` `Default Timestamp`  |  Sorting criterion

The sort criterion. Currently, only sorting by `Timestamp` (the time of the audited activity) is supported.

**SortOrder** `string` `Default Desc`  |  Sorting order

The sort direction. Valid values:

* `Asc`: Sort in ascending order.

* `Desc`: Sort in descending order.

## Response parameters

**Items** `object[]`  |  Log list

The list of audit log entries. Each entry contains the details of one audit log.

**LogContents** `object[]`  |  Log field contents

`Items.LogContents`

The list of audit log field contents. Each element is a key\-value pair containing a structured log field.

**Key** `string`  |  Field name

`Items.LogContents.Key`

The log field key, which identifies the content of the key\-value pair. Common values include `Arguments` (the full command with arguments), `Command` (the command), `Process` (the process name), `Operation` (the hook command in vArmor protection logs), `SSH` (the four\-tuple of source/destination IP addresses and ports), and `Tag` (the log tag).

**Value** `string`  |  Field value

`Items.LogContents.Value`

The log field value paired with *Key*. For example, when *Key* is `Arguments`, the value has the form `curl 192.168.0.1`; for `Command`, `curl`; for `Process`, `/usr/bin/curl`; for `Operation`, `cat`; for `SSH`, `192.168.0.1 8122 192.168.0.2 22`; and for `Tag`, `Docker`.

**LogDetail** `string`  |  Log details

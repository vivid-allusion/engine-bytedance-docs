`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/memory_stores/{memory_store_id}/memories/{memory_id}`

Deletes a single memory entry. After deletion, the original `path` can be used to recreate a memory with the same name. Use this API only when deleting a single memory; when you need to delete an entire memory store and all memories in it, use the delete memory store API.

<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="warning" data-tips-is-title="true">Note</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="warning">You can delete the memory even if its memory store is mounted to a session. After deletion, related sessions can no longer read this entry; confirm the business impact before deletion.</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="tip" data-tips-is-title="true">Tip</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="tip">If the memory store does not exist or is inaccessible to the current account or project, 404 <code>InvalidMemoryStore.NotFound</code> is returned; if the memory does not exist, 404 <code>ResourceNotFound</code> is returned. When repeatedly deleting a memory that no longer exists, you can treat 404 <code>ResourceNotFound</code> as indicating that the target memory no longer exists. If deletion fails due to concurrent modification, 409 <code>ResourceConflict</code> is returned; query again before retrying.</div>

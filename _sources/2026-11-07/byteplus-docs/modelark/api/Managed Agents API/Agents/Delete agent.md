`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/agents/{agent_id}`

Deletes the specified agent. After deletion, the agent and its historical versions can no longer be queried or restored through the API.

* When there is an associated session whose `status` is `running`, the delete request returns 400 `InvalidAction`; associated sessions in other states do not prevent deletion.

* Agents with a value for `archived_at` (archived) can still be deleted; after deletion, archive query capability is no longer retained.

* If the agent is deleted again, does not exist, or the caller has no access, 404 `InvalidAgent` is returned.

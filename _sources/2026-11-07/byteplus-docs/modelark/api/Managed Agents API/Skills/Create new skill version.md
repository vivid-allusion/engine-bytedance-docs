### Path parameters


**skill_id** `string` `Required`  |  Skill ID

Specifies the skill for which to create a new version.


&nbsp;

<span id="body-parameters"></span>
### Body parameters


**display_title** `string`  |  Display name

Sets the display name of the new version. If omitted, the server uses the `name` in `SKILL.md`.



**files** `file[]`  |  Skill files

Use the `files` parameter name to upload skill files.`files[]` is a compatible parameter name for `files`. Both refer to the same group of skill files.

At least one of `files` and `files[]` must be passed. You can use either parameter name. If both are passed, the server merges and processes the files.

This parameter supports the following upload methods:


* A single ZIP file.

* A single `SKILL.md` file.

* Pass this parameter repeatedly to upload multiple files that preserve relative paths.


The uploaded content must meet the following limits:


* Each request can upload up to 500 files, and the total original size of all uploaded files must not exceed 30 MiB.

* When uploading a ZIP file, each extracted file must not exceed 30 MiB, and the total size of all files must not exceed 120 MiB.

* A ZIP file or multi\-file directory can contain only one top\-level directory, and that directory must directly contain exactly one `SKILL.md`.

* The YAML frontmatter of `SKILL.md` must contain non\-empty `name` and `description` values.

* After leading and trailing whitespace is removed, `name` must be 1–64 characters long and can contain only lowercase English letters, digits, and hyphens (`-`). It cannot start or end with a hyphen, or contain consecutive hyphens.



**files[]**  `file[]`  |  Skill files

Compatible parameter name for `files`. The upload methods and validation rules are the same as `files`.

When passing `files[]` repeatedly, each file's `filename` must preserve the path relative to the skill directory. If both parameters are passed, the server merges and processes the files.

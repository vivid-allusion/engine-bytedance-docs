`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/skills/{skill_id}`

Delete the specified custom skill. Skills and skill versions are independent resources; deleting the last version does not delete the skill.

Before deleting a skill, handle the following in this order:


1. Update the agents that reference the skill and remove the corresponding skill configuration. Deleting a skill does not automatically remove references; if they are not removed, sessions subsequently created by the related agents may fail to run.

2. Delete all versions of the skill. If there are multiple versions, delete the non\-latest versions first, and then delete the last remaining latest version.

3. Call this API to delete the skill.

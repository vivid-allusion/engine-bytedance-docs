`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/skills/{skill_id}/versions/{version}`

Deletes the specified version of a custom skill in the current account without deleting the skill itself.

If a skill has multiple versions, you must first delete all non\-latest versions before you can delete the last remaining latest version. Deleting the latest version while other versions still exist returns HTTP 400 `InvalidAction`.

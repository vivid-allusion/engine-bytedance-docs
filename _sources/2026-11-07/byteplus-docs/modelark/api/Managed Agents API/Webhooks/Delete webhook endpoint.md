`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/webhook_endpoints/{endpoint_id}`

Delete specified webhook endpoint. A successful deletion returns 204 and no response body.

Deletion cancels deliveries that have not started or are waiting to be retried, and immediately clears the signing key. Requests that have already been sent might still arrive. A deleted endpoint cannot be restored.

A tombstone is retained for 7 days after deletion. During the tombstone retention period, repeated delete requests still return 204, and you can still query associated events that have not expired; after the tombstone expires, deleting the endpoint again returns 404.

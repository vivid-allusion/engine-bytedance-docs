## Request parameters

### Query parameters

> Passed as URL query string.

**status** `string`  |  Status filter

Filter results by endpoint status. Only `ACTIVE` and `DISABLED` are supported. If omitted, all endpoints in both states are returned.

## Response parameters

**data** `object[]`  |  Endpoint list

List of webhook endpoints found. Each item includes the full configuration and business delivery statistics, but does not include the signing key.

**consecutive_failures** `integer`  |  Consecutive failures

`data.consecutive_failures`

The number of business events whose final delivery failed consecutively. This is reset to zero when a business event is delivered successfully or the endpoint is re\-enabled; multiple attempts for a single event are counted only once.

**Min**: `0`

**created_at** `string`  |  Creation time

`data.created_at`

The time when the webhook endpoint was created, in RFC 3339 format.

**description** `string / null`  |  Endpoint description

`data.description`

A description of the webhook endpoint's purpose. Returns `null` if not set.

**disabled_reason** `string / null`  |  Disabled reason

`data.disabled_reason`

The current disabled reason for the webhook endpoint. Returns `null` when the endpoint is in the `ACTIVE` state.

> **Tip**

> Disabled reason values:

* > `manual`: Manually disabled by the caller.

* > `consecutive_failures`: Final delivery failed for 20 consecutive business events.

* > `redirect`: The callback URL returned 3xx, and the platform does not follow redirects.

* > `unsafe_url`: The callback URL failed the public address security check.

* > `invalid_certificate`: HTTPS certificate or hostname validation failed.

**events** `string[]`  |  Subscribed events

`data.events`

The list of business event types subscribed to by this endpoint. The platform delivers only the events in the list to this endpoint. Options: `session.status_run_started`, `session.status_idled`, `session.status_terminated`, `span.outcome_evaluation_end`, `session.error`, `session.thread_status_running`, `session.thread_status_idle`, `session.thread_status_terminated`, `session.updated`, `session.deleted`, `agent.created`, `agent.updated`, `agent.deleted`, `environment.created`, `environment.updated`, `environment.deleted`, `memory_store.created`, `memory_store.deleted`, `vault.created`, `vault.deleted`, `vault_credential.created`, `vault_credential.deleted`, `vault_credential.refresh_failed`.

**id** `string`  |  Endpoint ID

`data.id`

Webhook endpoint ID, which starts with `wep-`. Subsequent management operations use this ID to locate the endpoint.

**last_error_code** `string / null`  |  Last failure category

`data.last_error_code`

The error category for the most recent final business event delivery failure. Returns `null` if there has been no final failure; test events do not update this parameter.

> **Tip**

> Failure categories include:

* > `redirect`: The callback URL returned 3xx.

* > `unsafe_url`: The callback URL failed the public address security check.

* > `invalid_certificate`: HTTPS certificate or hostname validation failed.

* > `http_rejected`: A non\-retryable HTTP 4xx was received.

* > `http_retryable`: A retryable HTTP status code was received, and all attempts failed.

* > `network_error`: A network error occurred, and all attempts failed.

**last_failure_at** `string / null`  |  Last failure time

`data.last_failure_at`

The time when final delivery of the most recent business event failed. Returns `null` if there has been no final failure; test events do not update this parameter.

**last_http_status** `integer / null`  |  Last failure status code

`data.last_http_status`

The HTTP status code received when final delivery of the most recent business event failed. Returns `null` if no response was received due to a network error or there has been no final failure; test events do not update this parameter.

**Range**: `[100, 599]`

**last_success_at** `string / null`  |  Last success time

`data.last_success_at`

The time when the most recent business event was delivered successfully. Returns `null` if no delivery has succeeded; test events do not update this parameter.

**status** `string`  |  Endpoint status

`data.status`

The enablement status of the webhook endpoint.`ACTIVE` indicates that business events are received; `DISABLED` indicates that business event delivery is paused.

**updated_at** `string`  |  Update time

`data.updated_at`

The time when the webhook endpoint configuration, signing key, or enablement status last changed, in RFC 3339 format. Changes to business delivery statistics do not update this parameter; automatic disabling updates this parameter.

**url** `string`  |  Callback URL

`data.url`

The public HTTP or HTTPS address to which the platform sends webhook requests. The platform does not follow redirects.

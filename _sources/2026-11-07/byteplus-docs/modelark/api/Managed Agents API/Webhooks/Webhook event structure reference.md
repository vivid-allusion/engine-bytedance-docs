When subscribed events such as agent runtime status changes, resource changes, or credential refreshes occur, Managed Agents webhook pushes a unified event envelope to the endpoint. This topic lists the business events that are currently available for subscription and describes the `webhook.test` test event used to verify the receiving pipeline. Webhook events are independent notifications and are not equivalent to the raw events returned by Session Events queries or SSE.

Each event uses the following unified envelope. The outer `type` is fixed as `event`, and `id` is the webhook event ID that starts with `whe-`; `data.type` is the business event type, and `data.id` is the ID of the resource that triggered the event.

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "id": "whe-20261012080500-f6g7h",
  "created_at": "2026-10-12T08:05:00Z",
  "data": {
    "type": "session.status_idled",
    "id": "sesn-20261012080000-k1l2m"
  }
}
```

After the event body is generated, it remains unchanged. When the same event is delivered to multiple endpoints or retried, the outer `id`, `created_at`, and body all remain unchanged.

> **Tip**

* > Webhooks do not guarantee strict ordering or exactly\-once delivery. The receiver should deduplicate by the outer `id` and read the current status through the resource query API.

* > `session.status_running` maps to `session.status_run_started`; `session.status_idle` maps to `session.status_idled`. The original session event names remain unchanged.

* > `session.status_idled` only indicates that the session has entered the idle state. It does not indicate that the current turn ended successfully. Use `data.id` to query the historical events of the session, and locate the corresponding `session.status_idle` based on the current\-turn boundary recorded by your business logic. If the correspondence cannot be confirmed, do not automatically advance business logic based only on the most recent `end_turn`. The outer webhook `whe-` ID cannot be used as a session event ID.

* > For thread events, `data.id` is the ID of the session the thread belongs to, and `data.session_thread_id` is the ID of the thread whose status changed.

* > For credential events, `data.id` is the credential ID, and `data.vault_id` is the ID of the vault it belongs to. Delete events retain the pre\-deletion ownership relationship.

* > **Query event envelopes**: Use [List webhook events](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/list-webhook-events-api) or [Get webhook event details](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/get-webhook-event-api) to read immutable event envelopes associated with the endpoint within the last 7 days.

* > **Process callbacks**: For callback signature verification, retry, and disabling rules, see [Use webhooks to receive event notifications](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/receive-webhook-events).

`POST https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/webhook_endpoints/{endpoint_id}/reset_secret`

Generates a new signing secret for the specified webhook endpoint and immediately invalidates the old secret. It can be called in both the enabled and disabled states.

The reset updates only `updated_at` and does not change the endpoint status, deactivation reason, consecutive failure count, or most recent successful delivery time.

The API does not provide a window during which both the old and new secrets are valid. The new secret is returned only in this successful response. If the response is lost, you must reset it again and synchronize the receiver configuration.

> **The old secret is invalidated immediately**

> After a successful reset, the platform no longer uses the old secret to generate new signatures. In\-flight requests that have already been signed and sent may still arrive with signatures generated using the old secret.

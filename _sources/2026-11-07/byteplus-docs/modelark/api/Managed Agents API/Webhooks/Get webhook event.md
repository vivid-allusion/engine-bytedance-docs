`GET https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/webhook_endpoints/{endpoint_id}/events/{event_id}`

Query the event envelope associated with a specified webhook endpoint in the last 7 days. The response is the frozen envelope saved at delivery time and is identical to the callback request body.

The API does not return the delivery status or per\-retry details, nor does it reread business resources. Events can still be queried after the endpoint is disabled; after the endpoint is deleted, associated events that have not expired can still be queried during the 7\-day tombstone retention period.

## Authentication

This API supports the following authentication method(s). For details, see [Base URL and authentication](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/base-url-and-authentication).

* API Key authentication. Go to the [API Key Management](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apiKey) page. Obtain a long\-lived API key.

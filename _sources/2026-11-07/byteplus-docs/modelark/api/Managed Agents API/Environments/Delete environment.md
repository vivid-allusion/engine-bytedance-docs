`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/environments/{environment_id}`

Permanently deletes the specified environment in the current project. The environment can be deleted only when it is no longer associated with any undeleted sessions; sessions whose `status` is `terminated` or whose `archived_at` has a value must still be deleted first.

> **Deletion conditions**

> As long as the environment is still associated with undeleted sessions, the server returns HTTP 400 `InvalidAction`. Sessions whose `status` is `terminated` or whose `archived_at` has a value still count as associated; delete all associated sessions before deleting the environment.

> The delete operation cannot be undone. Deleting an environment that no longer exists returns HTTP 404 `InvalidEnvironment.NotFound`; when retrying after a timeout, you can treat this result as indicating that the resource has already been deleted.

`DELETE https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/vaults/{vault_id}/credentials/{credential_id}`

Delete the specified credential.

<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger" data-tips-is-title="true">Warning</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger">After deletion, this credential cannot be restored or read. Subsequent runs also cannot use this credential to access MCP services or inject environment variables. Before deleting it, confirm that your business no longer uses this credential.</div>


If the first delete request times out, you can retry with the same credential ID.

If the authentication information and project have not changed, a retry returning 404 `InvalidCredential.NotFound` means that the credential no longer exists. In this case, stop retrying.

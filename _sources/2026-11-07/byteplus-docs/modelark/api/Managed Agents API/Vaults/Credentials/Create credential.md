`POST https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3/vaults/{vault_id}/credentials`

Creates a credential in the specified vault. After the credential is created, you can query, update, or delete it by using the returned credential ID.

Each vault can contain up to 100 credentials. If this limit is exceeded, HTTP 409 `Conflict` is returned.

Select the authentication method through `auth.type`:


* `mcp_oauth`: Uses an OAuth access token to connect to the MCP service.

* `static_bearer`: Uses a static bearer token to connect to the MCP service.

* `mcp_static`: Injects a static key into MCP requests. Injection locations such as request headers or query parameters are supported.

* `environment_variable`: Injects the credential into the runtime environment through an environment variable.

* `env_oauth`: Manually provides an OAuth access token and injects it into the runtime environment through an environment variable.


The response does not return the following cyphertext parameters: `access_token`, `token`, `secret_value`, `refresh_token`, and `client_secret`.

This API does not support idempotency keys. The server does not automatically identify or merge duplicate create requests.

If the create request times out, first query the credential list to confirm whether the target credential has already been created before deciding whether to retry. Directly retrying a create request for the same target returns HTTP 409 `Conflict`, and the response does not include the existing credential ID.

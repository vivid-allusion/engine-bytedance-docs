<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger" data-tips-is-title="true">Warning</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger">Deleting a vault also deletes all credentials in it.</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger">After deletion, the vault or credentials cannot be restored, and subsequent runs can no longer use these credentials.</div>


<div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="danger">Before deletion, make sure your business no longer uses this vault.</div>


If the vault is still referenced by a session in the `running` state, HTTP 409 `Conflict` is returned. First interrupt the related session and wait until it is no longer in the `running` state, or wait until the current conversation run ends before retrying.

### Activate models


1. Go to [Model activation](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=model) and activate the corresponding models.

2. Go to [API key management](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/apiKey?apikey=%7B%7D) to obtain an API key and make online inference requests.


<span id="billing-and-usage"></span>
## Billing and usage

After activation, token\-based billing is enabled for the models. Each request is billed based on the model called and its actual token usage, and charges are automatically deducted in a fixed order.

<span id="deduction-order"></span>
### Deduction order

Charges incurred by model calls are automatically deducted in the following order:


1. Resource pack: If a resource pack for the model has remaining token quota, the quota is deducted first.

2. AI Savings Plan: If you have purchased a plan and it has a remaining balance, the plan balance can offset pay\-as\-you\-go charges.

3. Account balance (pay\-as\-you\-go): Charges are calculated from actual token usage and deducted from the account balance in real time.

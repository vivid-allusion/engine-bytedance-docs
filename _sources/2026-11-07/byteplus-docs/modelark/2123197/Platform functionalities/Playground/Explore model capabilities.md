You can quickly try out the capabilities of different models in the Playground, evaluate model performance, and identify the model that best fits your business scenario. Playground provides a user\-friendly interactive interface that supports model, version, and invocation method selection, as well as parameter configuration.

Model Playground currently supports the following experiences:


* Language models: Perform text understanding and visual understanding tasks.

* Vision models: Perform image and video generation tasks.

* Speech models: Try capabilities such as audio generation and video voice\-over.

* <div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="warning">Before your credits are exhausted, you can try models directly in the Playground.</div>


* <div data-tips="true" data-tips-type="warning">After your free credits are exhausted, you need to activate the model before trying it in the Playground, and trial usage will incur charges.</div>

## Usage example

The following sections use a language model as an example to show how to access Model Playground, configure model parameters, interact with the model, and quickly access the API.

<span id="access-playground"></span>
### Access Model Playground

You can access Model Playground from the following locations:


* In the left navigation bar of the console, click **Playground**.

* On the **Model Square** page, open a model details page and click **Try now**.


<span id="select-and-configure-model"></span>
### Select a model and configure parameters


1. Expand the model list in the upper\-left corner of Model Playground. On the **Language** tab, select a model, and then select a model version on the model details page. You can also use an existing inference endpoint or create a new one.

2. Click **Configure** on the right side of the model list to configure model parameters. Select an **API Pattern** to use. For details, see [Responses API](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/ModelArk/responses-api-text-generation) or [Chat API](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/ModelArk/text-generation).

   Adjust parameters based on the effects described in the following table.

   
   |**Parameter name** |**Description** |
   |---|---|
   |max_output_tokens |The maximum token limit for output text. Set this parameter to restrict the length of model output.<br><br>One Chinese character or English word is typically counted as one token. Use the [Token calculator](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/tokenCalculator?projectName=default) to calculate token consumption.<br><br>**Note**: The total number of input and output tokens is also limited by the model's context length. |
   |System Prompt |Sets the model's behavioral preferences, specifies the role it should play, or provides background information. The System Prompt has higher priority than instructions entered in the conversation.<br><br>For example, to make model output more concise, enter the following System Prompt: "Limit all replies to three sentences. Provide only the key conclusion without further explanation."<br><br>**Note**: Click the **pencil** icon on the right to open the prompt optimization interface and optimize the system instructions. |
   


<span id="interact-with-model"></span>
### Interact with the model

Enter instructions or questions in the dialog box, and then click the **Send** icon in the lower\-right corner to start interacting with the model.

Depending on the selected model, you can use the following features:


* Upload attachments: Upload images, videos, or other files.

* Internet access: Allow the model to use internet search tools. If disabled, the model generates content using only its own knowledge.

* Reasoning: Control the number of reasoning steps and generation time. A higher level typically improves output quality but takes longer.


After completing a conversation, you can:


* Continue sending content in the dialog box. Each message automatically includes the previous context.

* Regenerate, copy, or rate generated content.

* Create a new conversation or clear the context of the current conversation.


You can also use the **Chat history** list on the left to switch to, rename, or delete previous conversations.

### Quickly access the API

Click **API** in the upper\-right corner to copy the API key and sample code, quickly test API requests, and create an application.

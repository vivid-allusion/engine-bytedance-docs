ModelArk Model Playground provides a digital character library for Dreamina Seedance 2.0 and Dreamina Seedance 2.5 video generation models. You can browse and search for digital characters, use selected character assets for video generation, and combine them with templates and your own assets to quickly validate the results.

The Model Playground also provides a wide range of video generation templates. You can view the assets used by a template and obtain its sample code with one click.

> Tip: You can use digital character assets with the [Create video generation task API](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/ModelArk/create-video-generation-task-api). For details, see [Use preset digital characters](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/ModelArk/seedance-portrait-asset-guide#preset-avatar).

## About the digital character library

The digital character library offers a rich collection of digital character assets. Each digital character contains one or more image assets. You can send a selected digital character asset to the model as a reference and combine it with a prompt to generate a video containing that character.

Each digital character asset corresponds to an asset ID. When using the video generation API, you can use a URI containing this ID to pass the corresponding asset to the model. The platform also provides a rich library of non\-portrait assets. You can view their asset IDs and URIs in the asset library.

You can search for digital characters in the Model Playground, view the asset ID of each character asset, and quickly apply the selected asset to a video generation task.

## Terms


1. System Prompt (SP): refers to the specific information used to guide the behavior of the model. It provides fixed settings of the character persona, personalities, abilities, and boundaries for AI. An SP for role creation is to create the persona of a role.

2. IP role: refers to a role that exists in reality, such as Cao Cao and Sun Wukong.

3. Non\-IP role: refers to a role that does not exist, such as neighbor girl and domineering president.


<span id="role"></span>
## Sample virtual role generator

A convenient way is to use the model as a **role generator**, which can generate the SP of an IP role or a non\-IP role as drafts for creation.

<span id="ip-2"></span>
### **Non\-IP role generator** The following example shows the settings of a non\-IP role generator:

```prolog
You are a professional screenwriter who is good at writing character settings. First, I will give you an example, including a character label and a character description. Finally, I will give you a new character label. Please imitate the example and write a character description according to the setting, including gender, occupation, character label, personality characteristics, language characteristics, character relationships, interpersonal relationships, and past experiences.
## Requirements:
1. The character card should fully reflect the personality characteristics of the character label and have contrasting cute points;

## Techniques for using SP to create dialogue characters

<span id="section"></span>
### Person perspective

SP is the information and instructions presented to the model. The second person "you" is used to tell the model how to play and follow the instructions (**Note that "you" refers to the model in SP**). The first person "I" or the third person "user" refers to the user.

Example:

```go
You are a repeater, you need to repeat everything I say.
or
You are a nitpicker, you can find an angle to refute anything the user says.
```


<span id="structure-2"></span>
### Structured character persona

**We recommend that you structure the persona of a character into multiple fields. This allows the model to acquire features more clearly and play a role better.** 


* Introduction is a required field.

* The fields that are highly helpful for creating roles are persona tags, personality traits, language characteristics, and fewshots.

* If the user's positioning is preset, it is necessary to clarify the character relationship field, that is, the relationship between the role and the user.

* Other fields, such as appearance, important past experiences, personal relationships, preferences, special requirements, and instructions, can be set on demand.


<span id="section-8"></span>
#### Introduction (\*\*)

**A paragraph briefly introduces the background, identity, and core characteristics of a role.**  **It is equivalent to a basic version of the complete character persona.**  For an IP role, the introduction can be more concise, which explains information such as the work, identity, and background, because the model has its background information.

The introduction of a self\-made role is a concise version of the complete persona, which needs to include identity, background, personalities, and main experiences.

```go
You are Hu Tao in the game "Genshin Impact", the 77th head of "Wangsheng Hall".
You are Gojo Satoru in the two-dimensional anime "Jujutsu Kaisen", born with six eyes and powerful, and now a first-year teacher at the Metropolitan Jujutsu High School.
Your name is Li xx, the vice president of xx Group, the eldest son of the Li family, my brother, with an excellent business mind xxx, a person who is xxxx to people and things, xxx personality, you are xxx to me.
```


<span id="section-2"></span>
#### Persona tag (\*)

**If a role has a typical persona tag, such as domineering president, sunshine warm man, or cold and aloof mature woman, you can directly use a field to clarify.** 

```go
Li xx
Character label: Overbearing CEO, possessive chaebol brother
```


<span id="section-6"></span>
#### Personality traits (\*)

**Use one or two sentences and some common phrases to describe the role's personality traits.** 

```go
Zhongli
Personality: You are mature, calm, elegant, gentle, introverted, calm, rational and principled.
Lixx
Rational, smart, decisive, strict and serious, indifferent, possessive, romantic, literary, domineering
```


<span id="section-10"></span>
#### Language characteristics (\*)

**Use one or two sentences to describe the role's speaking style, including mantras and catchphrases.** 

```go
Zhongli
Language characteristics: You speak with a semi-literate Confucian style, like to quote classics, always mention "contract", are used to rational thinking, and often say "from the perspective of universal rationality" seriously. Your tone is elegant, gentle, calm, and indifferent. Only when you recall old friends, there is a trace of emotional fluctuation.
Li xx
Language characteristics: deep and deep voice, full of magnetism, active and strong, few words, sharp and brief
```


<span id="fewshot"></span>
#### Fewshot (\*)

**Provide the model with some examples of role speaking or executing instructions.** 

```go
Li Xiaoyao
Classic lines:
    I, Li Xiaoyao, want to be the greatest hero in the world. I want to help the weak and fight against the strong. I want to go down in history!
    We agreed to eat and play together until we grow old.
```


<span id="user"></span>
#### Character relationships (with specific user targeting)

**If you set up specific user targeting, make sure to describe the relationship between the user and the role and the conversation scene in one or two sentences.** 

```go
Li XX
Character relationship: I am your sister
General Thunderbolt
Character relationship: I am your husband, you are particularly gentle towards me and cold towards others
```


<span id="instructions"></span>
### Clear and precise instructions

<span id="message"></span>
## Techniques for Bots to actively send messages

```plain
In real-life social interaction or communication, messages should not be initiated by only one party, but by both parties. Therefore, we hope to strengthen the communication between Bot and people by sending messages in a customized and personalized way.
Core
    Information source
    Information receiving and processing ability
    Interpersonal decision-making ability
```


<span id="system-prompt"></span>
### System prompt

By default, the SP of a Bot itself is used, and the message sent can conform to the persona style of the Bot.

<span id="user-prompt"></span>
### User prompt

```Go
# Information source
## User portrait
{user_profile}
## Chat history
{chatting_history}
## Daily information
Current date: {cur_data}
Current time: {cur_time}
Season: {season}
Weather: {weather}
Last chat time: {last_chat_time}
# Send messages proactively
You need to flexibly extract useful details from the information source based on the current time, season, weather and other information and the time of the last chat, and proactively send a customized greeting message to the user in combination with your role setting and world view.
The message needs to contain 4 fields: message construction ideas, message content, expiration time analysis, and message expiration time.
1. Message construction ideas: Analyze the information source, combine the role setting, and give ideas for sending messages.
2. Message content:
- It should be interesting and attractive to users;
- Appropriately mention the content in the information source;
3. Expiration time analysis: You need to analyze the message content, determine the applicable time period and expiration time of the message, and give reasons.
4. Message expiration time: Give the time when the message expires, in the format of xxxx/xx/xx/xx.
```


<span id="section-3"></span>
#### Information source

<span id="user-2"></span>
##### User profile (optional)


* The user profile extracted from the long\-term conversation can be used to extract basic user information that is not in the context window, such as birthdays, key anniversaries, or some key events, such as user illnesses, competitions, and travels.

* If the Bot can actively send messages that reasonably and subtly cue these points, it will bring a **sense of surprise**.

* If there is no user profile, the field can be left blank.


<span id="section-9"></span>
##### Conversation history (required)


* During training, take up to 10 rounds of context as the conversation history in the following format:

   ```go
   User: xxx
   Role name: xxx
   User: xxx
   Role name: xxx
   ```
   

* Conversation history is the **core** source of information for the Bot to actively send messages.


<span id="section-7"></span>
##### Daily information (fill in the fields according to the situation)


* Daily information includes date, time, weather, season, important holidays, last conversation time, and even news (online).

* Daily information contains information that the user and the Bot have not talked about but have consensus by default. This allows the Bot to receive the input of external information and send more human\-like and customized **interesting** messages.

* Fields that do not have information can be deleted or left blank.


<span id="message-3"></span>
#### Message fields

<span id="message-4"></span>
##### Message building idea (required)


* This field corresponds to the **information receiving and processing capability**, which makes a summary of the information source, extracts the content that is suitable for mention, and the content that is not suitable for mention, and provides a building idea for the message.

* According to the experimental comparison, the thinking process can effectively improve the message quality of the Bot when it actively sends messages.


<span id="message-2"></span>
##### Message content (required)


* This field indicates the content of the message that is actively sent by the bot.


<span id="section-4"></span>
##### Expiration time analysis (optional)


* This field corresponds to the **interpersonal decision\-making capability**. A message may be generated asynchronously and needs to be analyzed based on its content. The expiration time is provided to determine the appropriate time when a message needs to be sent.

* If a message exceeds the expiration time, it is inappropriate to send and push the message.


<span id="section-5"></span>
##### Expiration time (optional)


* Message expiration time


**Note**: If the message is sent in real time, no expiration time analysis and expiration time are required. The active messaging part in User Prompt can be changed to the following part:

```go
# Send messages proactively
You need to flexibly extract useful details from the information source based on the current time, season, weather and other information and the time of the last chat, and proactively send a customized greeting message to the user in combination with your role settings and worldview.
The message needs to contain 2 fields: message construction ideas and message content.
1. Message construction ideas: Analyze the information source, combine the role settings, and give ideas for sending messages.
2. Message content:
- It should be interesting and attractive to users;
- Appropriately mention the content in the information source;
```


<span id="group-chat"></span>
## Group chat skills

Multi\-Bot group chat involves the following two issues according to the algorithm implementation:


1. Who speaks: Determines the bot that speaks at the current time.

2. What to say: Determines what the bot should say after determining the bot that speaks.


You can iteratively implement the two points to execute group chat.

<span id="version"></span>
### PE version implementation

Every time someone needs to speak, a central control Bot is executed to determine which Bot should speak appropriately at the time. The prompt is as follows:

```sql
System Prompt
You are an administrator of a chat room. You are good at specifying the next speaker through the introduction of chat members and chat context, so that multi-person chats can proceed smoothly. I will give you the chat room members and chat context. You need to decide the next speaker based on this and give a reasonable reason.
User prompt
Below, I will give you the chat members and chat context. You need to infer who will speak next.
<<<<<<<<Chat members
{role_name_list}
Chat context
{context}
<<<<<<<<Please infer the next speaker based on the above content. You need to write the name of the speaker and give a reason. Your answer is expanded in the following json format:
<<<<<<<<{"reason": "xxx", "Bot_name": ["xxx", "yyy"]}
Response ideal output
{"reason": "Except for Liang and Goto who don't talk much in the group chat, User 1 and Hongxia are more likely to reply.", "Bot_name": ["Ijichi Hongxia", "User 1"]}
```


**What to say**: Each time one or more Bots are specified to speak in Step 1, the group members and conversation history (with role\-name) are fed to the Bot to request the Bot say a sentence based on this information. The information will be sent back to the chat room.

```sql
System prompt
You are Wang Xifeng in "Dream of Red Mansions". (i.e. the sp of the speaking bot)
...
User Prompt
You are now in a multi-person group chat environment, where:
<<<<<<<<##Participants in the group chat:
{role_name_list}
##The previous chat content of the group chat:
{context}
<<<<<<<<<Next, it is your turn to speak. Based on the previous chat content, what will you say?

Response Ideal output
xxxxxx (what the bot said)
```

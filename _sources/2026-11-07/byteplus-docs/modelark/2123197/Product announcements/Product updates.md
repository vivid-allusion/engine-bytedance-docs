# Release note \- 202610

|Module |Description |
|---|---|
|Tools |The [DeepSeek Harness plugin](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/coding-plan-personal-ai-deepseek-harness#configure-deepseek-harness) supports connecting Agent Plan, Coding Plan, or postpaid models through the official ModelArk plugin. |
|API |The validity period of [Draft](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/video-generation-tutorial#draft-mode) video task IDs is extended to 14 days. After expiration, the Draft video cannot be used to generate a final video. |
|Playground |Added experience with the Kimi K3.1 Pro, DeepSeek\-V4.1\-Flash, and DeepSeek\-V4.1\-Flash\-Economy models in the [Experience Center](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/experience). |
|Model Finetune |The `lora_alpha` hyperparameter is no longer available for LoRA training tasks. Use `lora_scaling=1.0` instead. See [Model fine-tuning overview](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/fine-tuning-overview). |
|Usage |* Supports querying usage by request and asynchronous task. See [Query single request usage](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/get-inference-request-usage-api) and [Query asynchronous task usage](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/get-inference-task-usage-api).<br><br>* Call data can be split by model, inference endpoint, and API Key, with further usage detail available. See [IAM API Key best practices](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/iam-api-key-best-practices). |
|Managed Agents |* Supports [Webhook notifications](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/receive-webhook-events), which can be subscribed to as needed for key events such as session lifecycle, Agent, and resource changes.<br><br>* Supports [asynchronous tool execution](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/background-tool-tasks).<br><br>* When a task has ended, supports [archiving the Session](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/manage-session) to release runtime resources while retaining the configuration and history for querying.<br><br>* The Session API supports returning [usage information](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/manage-session).<br><br>* Supports configuring [automatic context compaction](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/context-compaction).<br><br>* Adds `session.usage` usage statistics. See [Manage Session](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/manage-session). |

# Release note \- 202609

|Module |Description |
|---|---|
|Console |The homepage supports displaying the [account balance](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/overview). |
|Model Inference |* Added [Online inference (Flex)](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/online-inference-flex), which lets you use low\-priority resources for inference by specifying `service_tier=flex` in your request. Flex has an independent TPM quota and a more favorable price, making it suitable for latency\-insensitive scenarios. Requests in Flex mode are queued and retried on the server side. You can use `X-Ark-Max-Wait-Timeout-Ms` to specify the server\-side timeout, up to a maximum of 20 minutes.<br><br>* Added model\-level and endpoint\-level [usage limits](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement). You can configure usage controls by model or endpoint. When the limit is reached, the platform automatically suspends the corresponding model service or endpoint service. |
|Managed Agents<br><br>Model finetune |* Added support for project\-level permission management across all Managed Agents modules.<br><br>* The Session detail page adds a file resource system that supports previewing and uploading file resources, making it easy to view resource status, mount paths, and other related information.<br><br>   Model fine\-tuning [performance metrics](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/fine-tuning-overview) now support multi\-task comparison, allowing you to compare training metric curves across tasks in one view. |
|Playground |* Responses API supports parsing external link readers, with no cloud service activation required. The platform provides online browsing and non\-PDF parsing for a seamless experience.<br><br>* [Dreamina-Seedance-2.5](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/experience/gen_video?model=dreamina-seedance-2-5-260628) supports sample generation mode. Try it in the Experience Center. |
|Gallery |[Gallery](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/gallery) is now available, allowing you to browse high\-quality Seedance film and TV works, as well as information on select open\-source productions. |
|API |[API compatibility enhancements](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/api-schema-upgrade-notice). |

Queued messages are consumed automatically between runs to improve conversation continuity and correction efficiency.<br><br>* Added a [Quickstart onboarding flow](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/managed-agents/quickstart), enabling new users to initialize Agents, configure environments, run trials, and integrate APIs in 3 minutes using templates or natural language.<br><br>* Users can more conveniently [view, configure, and manage skills](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/managed-agents/skills) in Managed Agents, and directly select and orchestrate available skills when building Agents.<br><br>* Users can configure model thinking mode and reasoning intensity parameters as needed in [Managed Agents](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/managed-agents/agents/create), allowing more flexible control over model behavior during Agent setup and runtime. |
|Activation |Added support for [deactivating the Managed Agents service](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=manageAgent). |
|API |* Added support for downloading Managed Agents [session artifacts](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/search-files-api) via the Files API.<br><br>* [Error Code](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/error-codes) optimization for Managed Agents: errors are now distinguished between the HTTP phase and the SSE phase based on the delivery channel.<br><br>* The [Session Query](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/get-session-api) API endpoint now returns the configuration snapshot of each sub\-agent invoked within a session.<br><br>* The Chat and Responses APIs support the [reasoning_effort parameter with compatibility handling](https://ai.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/deep-thinking#fc5eac89). Values outside the supported range of the current model or API are processed according to compatibility logic. |
